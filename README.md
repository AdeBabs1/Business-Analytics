# Project 7

**Title** : [D HOSPITAL DASHBOARD](https://github.com/AdeBabs1/dataanalytics)

**Description** : D Hospital performance.

This Hospital Transaction Dashboard provides a comprehensive visual representation of key financial and operational metrics for a healthcare facility. 

Data Sourced from Structured hospital transaction data, from the electronic health records (EHR).

It is designed to aid decision-makers—such as hospital administrators, financial analysts, and healthcare managers—in monitoring revenue, expenses, profitability, 

and service utilization across various specialties and procedures.

The dashboard was developed to aggregate, visualize, and analyze hospital transaction data. KPIs for high-level overview:

Detailed visual analytics, including: Revenue trends by year and quarter, Revenue distribution by specialty and category, Revenue, expenses, and margin breakdown by procedure, 

and Filters for doctor and patient gender, state, and year

Microsoft Power BI and Excel tools were used for initial ETL Processes (Extract, Transform, Load):

DAX functions for metric calculations like profit margins, revenue totals, and transaction counts.

Data Visualization tools like KPI cards, charts, and tables for presentation and creating graphs and charts for time trends, specialties, and procedure details.

Slicers and filters for interactivity with the data by gender, state, and year and for dashboard Interactivity.

The Dashboard as a whole Investigates and advised based on insights

Declining Revenue: The sharp drop in 2023 Q2 and Q3 should be urgently analyzed. Possible causes include reduced patient intake, lower procedure volume, or billing inefficiencies.

Resource Optimization: With almost one doctor per patient, re-evaluate staff deployment or explore patient acquisition strategies.

Focus on High-Yield Specialties and Procedures: Invest more in marketing or resources for Dermatology and high-margin procedures like Skin Biopsy and Knee Replacement.

Geographic and Gender Filtering: Leverage state-level and demographic insights (California vs. New York, male vs. female) to tailor services and outreach.

It successfully highlights areas of strength, such as overall profitability and high-performing specialties, while identifying risks like declining revenue and potential inefficiencies in doctor-to-patient allocation.

# Project 8

**Title** : [INSTACART PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD](https://github.com/AdeBabs1/dataanalytics)

**Description** : INSTACART (An E-Commerce) performance visualisation

I had used SQL in the past but this recent project reminded me of the power it has when compared to Excel and especially when complemented by a powerful visualisation tool like PBI.

First was the creation of the database in the Postgre SQL, then restoring my database, which led to seeing the Tables and fields in the database.

Using the query tool to bring me back to the last state or current state as at the last work on my SQL database and the use of the following query Syntax:
SELECT FROM;
ORDER BY;
WHERE
LIMIT;
INNER AND FULL JOINS;

I then used Power BI for ETL
1. Extract with Power Query
Using the Get Data feature, I connected to the SQL Database on PostgreSQL
This step is typically no-code and the connection is created between PBI and SQL and saved as part of the Power BI report.

2. Transform with Power Query Editor
After connecting to my data source (SQL database), Power BI automatically launches the Power Query Editor, this is where I was able to do major transformations like:
Remove duplicates and empty roles and null;
Filter rows;
Merged columns;
Changed data types; and
Created new and required calculated columns.
Each transformation step is recorded as a step in the “Applied Steps” pane, helping an iterative process if needed or as required.

3. Load into Power BI Model
Once the data is shaped and cleaned, I Closed & Applied it into Power BI’s in-memory data model. 
From here, I was able to:
Define relationships between tables using the ERD
Create measures and calculated columns using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), and
Begin to build dashboards and reports on top of the structured data

I presented the insights and solutions to stakeholders for the project.

# Project 9

**Title** : THE BACCM CONCEPT FOR A HEALTHCARE TRANSFORMATION PROJECT

**Description** [ZENITH MEDICAL ANALYSIS USING THE BACCM CONCEPT](https://github.com/AdeBabs1/dataanalytics)

Stakeholder Analysis and Engagement Strategy for Healthcare Transformation Project

Objective:
To apply structured business analysis methods, including the BACCM framework, to identify key issues in a medical centre and design a clear stakeholder engagement and responsibility structure to support proposed solutions.

Key Activities: 
The BACCM concept was analysed for understanding and then needs identification through GAP analysis was carried and results presented. Using key tools and techniques like, interviewing, Survey, and observation for requirements gathering.
The power vs interest grid, RACI matrix, for stakeholder analysis and Identification:
All internal and external stakeholders (clinical, administrative, technical, regulatory, and patients) were mapped using the BACCM model to understand their needs, value impact, and relationships with proposed changes. Then, a Stakeholder Power vs Interest Grid was designed to prioritise engagement and communication strategies. High-power, high-interest stakeholders like the CMD, CFO, and Head of IT were identified for active management and consultation.
A RACI Matrix was created to produce a detailed matrix assigning roles to identify those that are Responsible, Accountable, to be Consulted, and Informed, for each project task, including defining scope, requirements gathering, software introduction, and data integration. This helped clarify roles across cross-functional teams and minimized overlap or gaps in responsibility.

As a result, recommendations for a revamp of the Current patient appointment system which relies heavily on manual processes and phone calls, that makes the team struggle with increased demand, were provided including an enabled and structured stakeholder engagement and clear role alignment, which will set the stage for smoother implementation of healthcare process improvements and digital transformation initiatives.
